                I'm a Tennessee Tech Undergraduate (about to graduate in DECEMBER 2025)
                I've been working as a Computer Science major with a concentration in Cybersecurity for a while now
                and I've been trying to understand more about how the world interacts with my professional interests
                (that being a mix of networking, software development, and cybersecurity). Over time, I grew a bit bored of it 
                which may be due to school. Nowadays, my goals are to both code for myself, and enjoy myself whilst I learn
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, I want to be able to contribute more towards the field than I already have as both a 
                <span class="highlight ambassador">CEROC Ambassador</span> 
                and as an 
                <span class="highlight researcher"> AI-Cyber Researcher</span>. 
                Both jobs offered a lot in the ways of giving me opportunities and I think I'll be able to put 
                forward my best my next roles because of them.
                <br><br>
                Many programmers go through what is called the 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect">Overjustification Effect</a>
                as a result of their job, making them lose passion for this space. 
                This website is my answer to that, and I will continue to post what I love to it.
